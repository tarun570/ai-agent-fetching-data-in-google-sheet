# 🚀 Built a Simple AI Agent That Fetches Data from Google Sheets

I built a real-time AI automation where an AI Agent responds to chat messages by fetching live data from Google Sheets and using it to generate intelligent replies.

🔧 How it works:

💬 Trigger activates when a chat message is received

🤖 AI Agent processes the request

🧠 Uses Simple Memory to maintain context

📊 Reads student data directly from Google Sheets

🔍 AI uses the fetched data to generate accurate responses

This setup is useful for:

🎓 Student information systems

📞 Automated support bots

📋 Internal dashboards & query bots

⚡ Real-time data-driven AI responses
